# Analysis

This project was created as an Ethics4All Hackathon submission. This Hackathon attracted teams of people around the world passionate about using data to find solutions for a more equitable future. 

In my team, we sought to find a solution to racial bias in the criminal justice system. Here is our process.


We begin by looking at the number of Americans arrested by race. Due to an imbalance in our data, we log our black and white race variables to get a more accurate depiction on the disparity of arrests made by race.

Next, we create a breakout of crimes commited by race in the United States.

*Arrests of Native American People by Crime: US*


We compare our findings to data on convictions and prosecutions of people in England and Wales. There, we see a disparity between the comparions of arrests across race and total arrests overall.

*Percentage of Convictions by Race: UK*

*Percentage of Arrests by Race: US*


As we can see from our analysis, the rates of conviction are similar across race in England and Wales. When we break out the data to look at raw numbers of people prosecuted in the UK, we see that prosecutions are more in comparible with the distribution of race.

*Raw Data on Prosecution numbers by Race: UK*

When tempering for rates of arrests for crime type, we continue to see bias in arrests. Below, this graph represents the most commonly committed crime in our dataset across race other than "All other Crimes": DUIs.

*Total DUI Arrests in the US*


When we breakout our analysis to account for race, the racial disparities are readily apparent.
